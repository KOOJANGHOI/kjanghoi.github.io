### 1.3 algorithm specification 
an algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a particular task 

algorithms satisfy the following criteria
- zero or more inputs
- at least one output
- Definiteness (clear, unambiguous instructions) 
- Finiteness (terminates after a finite number of steps
- Effectiveness 

### 1.3.2 recursive algorithms 
- extremely powerful 
- allows us to express a complex process in very clear terms 
- establish boundary condition that terminate the recursive call 


### 1.4 data abstraction 
a data type is a collection of objects and a set of operations that act on those objects 

different data types in C 
- basic data type: char, int, float, double 
- composite data type: array, structure 
- user-defined data type
- pointer data type 

an abstract data type (ADT) is a data type that is organized in such a way that the specification of the objects and the operations on the objects is separated from the representation of the objects and the implementation of the operations 

### 1.5 performance evaluation 

- performance analysis (machine independent, complexity theory)
	- space complexity: the amount of memory that it needs to run to completion 
	- time complexity: the amount of computer time that it needs to run to completion 
- performance measurement (machine dependent)
