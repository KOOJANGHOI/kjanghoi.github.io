### Learning goals 
understanding both the building blocks and the design principles for construction of software systems 

- Ability to design medium-scale programs 
- Understanding OO programming concepts & design decisions 
- Proficiency with basic quality assurance techniques for functional correctness 
- Fundamentals of concurrency and distributed systems 
- Practical skills  

### Metrics of software quality 
- Sufficiency/functional correctness : Satisfies all of the specifications 
- Robustness : Recovers from all anomalous events 
- Flexibility : Easily adaptable to changes 
- Reusability : Usable without modification 
- Efficiency : satisfies requirements 
- Scalability : Can be used as the basis of a larger version
