### Introduction
In unicast routing, a packet is routed, hop by hop, from its source to its destination by the help of forwarding tables. The source host needs no forwarding table because it delivers its packet to the default router in its local network. The destination host needs no forwarding table either because it receives the packet from its default router in its local network. This means that only the routers that glue together the networks in the internet need forwarding tables. 

When an internet is modeled as a weighted graph, one of the ways to interpret the best route from the source router to the destination router is to find the least cost between the two. In other words, the source router chooses a route to the destination router in such a way that the total cost for the route is the least cost among all possible routes. 

### Routing algorithms
Several routing algorithms have been designed in the past. The differences between these methods are in the way they interpret the least cost and the way they create the least-cost tree for each node. 

#### Link state routing
A routing algorithm for creating least-cost trees and forwarding tables is link-state (LS) routing. This method uses the term link-state to define the characteristic of a link (an edge) that represents a network in the internet. In this algorithm the cost associated with an edge defines the state of the link. Links with lower costs are preferred to links with higher costs; if the cost of a link is infinity, it means that the link does not exist or has been broken.

#### Path vector routing
Both link-state and distance-vector routing are based on the least-cost goal. However, there are instances where this goal is not the priority. For example, assume that there are some routers in the internet that a sender wants to prevent its packets from going through. In other words, the least-cost goal, applied by LS or DV routing, does not allow a sender to apply specific policies to the route a packet may take. To respond to these demands, a third routing algorithm, called path-vector (PV) routing has been devised.
