### Basic Concepts 
Indexing mechanisms used to speed up access to desired data
- E.g., author catalog in library 

Search Key : attribute used to look up records in a file. 

An index file consists of records (called index entries) of the form 
- Index files are typically much smaller than the original file 
- Two basic kinds of indices: 
	- Ordered indices: search keys are stored in sorted order 
    - Hash indices: search keys are distributed uniformly across “buckets” using a “hash function”.  

### Multilevel Index 
- If primary index does not fit in memory, access becomes expensive. 
- To reduce number of disk accesses to index records, treat primary index kept on disk as a sequential file and construct a sparse index on it. 
    - outer index : a sparse index of primary index 
    - inner index : the primary index file 
- If even outer index is too large to fit in main memory, yet another level of index can be created, and so on. 
- Indices at all levels must be updated on insertion or deletion from the file.

### B+ tree index files
: B+-tree indices are an alternative to indexed-sequential files. 
Advantages of B+-trees outweigh disadvantages, and they are used extensively. 

Disadvantage of indexed-sequential files
- performance degrades as file grows, since many overflow blocks get created. Periodic reorganization of entire file is required.  

Advantage of B+-tree index files
- automatically reorganizes itself with small, local, changes, in the face of insertions and deletions. Reorganization of entire file is not required to maintain performance.  

Disadvantage of B+-trees
- extra insertion and deletion overhead, space overhead.  

A B+-tree is a rooted tree satisfying the following properties
- All paths from root to leaf are of the same length 
- Each node that is not a root or a leaf has between [n/2] and n children. 
- A leaf node has between [(n–1)/2] and n–1 values 
- Special cases: 
    - If the root is not a leaf, it has at least 2 children
    - If the root is a leaf (that is, there are no other nodes in the tree), it can have between 0 and (n–1) values.

### Summary

- Since the inter-node connections are done by pointers, “logically” close blocks need not be “physically” close. 
- The non-leaf levels of the B+-tree form a hierarchy of sparse indices. 
- The B+-tree contains a relatively small number of levels (logarithmic in the size of the main file), thus searches can be conducted efficiently. 
- Insertions and deletions to the main file can be handled efficiently, as the index can be restructured in logarithmic time (as we shall see).
