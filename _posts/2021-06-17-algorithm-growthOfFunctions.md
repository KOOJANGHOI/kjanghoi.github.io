### Three Asymptotic assumption 
- Big O-notation : asymptotic upper bound
- Big Omega-notation : asymptotic lower bound
- Big Theta-notation  : asymptotically tight bound

### Big O-notation
O(g(n)) = f(n)
: there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0

### Big Omega-notation
Ω(g(n)) = f(n)
: there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 ≤ cg(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0

### Big Theta-notation
Θ(g(n)) = f(n)
: there exist positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that 0 ≤ c1g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2g(n) for all n ≥ n0
