### Locks
- Ensure that any critical section executes as if if were a single atomic instruction
- Lock variable holds the state of the lock
    - Available / acquired
    - Unlocked / locked
    - Free / held

#### The semantics of the lock
- Try to acquire lock
- If no other thread holds the lock, the thread will acquire the lock
- Either the critical section
    - This thread is said to be the owner of the lock
- Other threads are prevented from entering the critical section while thread held lock is in there

#### Pthread Locks - mutex 
The name that POSIX library used to provide mutual exclusion between threads

#### Efficient lock and evaluating
- Efficient locks provide mutual exclusion at low cost
- Building a lock need some help from the hardware and the OS
- Evaluating
    - Mutual exclusion works
    - Fairness (starvation)
    - Performance : the overheads added by using the lock

### Atomic instruction

**Why Hardware support needed?**

Example : using flag denoting whether the lock is held or not

Problem
- Mutual exclusion not works
- Spin-wating wastes time waiting for another thread
    - Spin-waiting is correct : allows only a single thread to entry the critical section
    - Spin locks don’t provide any fairness guarantees. Indeed, a thread spinning may spin forever. 
    - in the single CPU, performance overheads can be quite painful. If the number of threads roughly equals the number of CPUs, spin locks work reasonably well.
    - Any time a thread gets caught spinning, it wastes an entire time slice doing nothing but checking a value.

#### TestAndSet
An instruction to support the creation of simple locks 
￼
![1.1](/assets/images/os/28.4.png)

- Return (testing) old value pointed to by the ptr
- Simultaneously updating(setting) said value to new
- This sequence of operations is performed atomically

![1.1](/assets/images/os/28.5.png)

#### Compare-And-Swap
Test whether the value at the address(ptr) is equal to expected. 
- If so, update the memory location pointed to by ptr with the new value. 
- In either case, return the actual value at that memory location.

#### Load-Linked and Store-Conditional

#### Ticket Lock 
Ticket lock can be built with fetch-and add
- Atomically increment a value while returning the old value at a particular address

![1.1](/assets/images/os/28.10.png)

- Ensure progress for all threads -> fairness
￼

#### A Simple Approach: Just Yield 
When you are going to spin, give up the CPU to another thread. 
- OS system call moves the caller from the running state to the ready state.
- The cost of a context switch can be substantial and the starvation problem still exists.

#### Using Queues: Sleeping Instead of Spinning 
- Queue to keep track of which threads are waiting to enter the lock. 
    - park() : Put a calling thread to sleep 
    - unpark(threadID) : Wake a particular thread as designated by threadID
- in case of releasing the lock (thread A) just before the call to park (thread B), Thread B would sleep forever (potentially)

#### Futex 
Linux provides a futex (is similar to Solaris’s park and unpark)

### Two-Phase Locks 
- A two-phase lock realizes that spinning can be useful if the lock is about to be released. 
    - First phase
        - The lock spins for a while, hoping that it can acquire the lock.
        - If the lock is not acquired during the first spin phase, a second phase is entered, 
    - Second phase
        - The caller is put to sleep.
        - The caller is only woken up when the lock becomes free later.
