### Introduction to Arrays 
An array is a data structure used to process a collection of data that is all of the same type 

An array behaves like a numbered list of variables with a uniform naming mechanism 


#### Declaring and Creating an Array 
An array is declared and created in almost the same way that objects are declared and created 

![7.1](/assets/images/object_oriented_programming/6.1.png)

The size may be given as an expression that evaluates to a nonnegative integer, for example, an int variable 

#### The length Instance Variable 
An array is considered to be an object  

Since other objects can have instance variables, so can arrays  
- Every array has exactly one instance variable named length  
- When an array is created, the instance variable length is automatically set equal to its size
- The value of length cannot be changed (other than by creating an entirely new array with new) 


#### Initializing Arrays 
An array can be initialized when it is declared 

![7.1](/assets/images/object_oriented_programming/6.2.png)

Another way of initializing an array is by using a for loop 

![7.1](/assets/images/object_oriented_programming/6.3.png)

If the elements of an array are not initialized explicitly, they will automatically be initialized to the default value for their base type 


#### Pitfall: An Array of Characters Is Not a String 

An array of characters is conceptually a list of characters, and so is conceptually like a string  

However, an array of characters is not an object of the class String  

e.g)
```
char[] a = {'A', 'B', 'C'};
String s = a; //Illegal!
```

An array of characters can be converted to an object of type String, however  
The class String has a constructor that has a single  parameter of type char[] 

e.g)
`String s = new String(a);`

The object s will have the same sequence of characters as the entire array a ("ABC"), but is an independent copy  
Another String constructor uses a subrange of a character array instead 

e.g)
```
String a = “ABC” 
String s2 = new String(a,0,2); // “AB” 
```

### Arrays and References
Like class types, a variable of an array type holds a reference 
- Arrays are objects 
- A variable of an array type holds the address of where the array object is stored in memory 
- Array types are (usually) considered to be class types 

**Arrays are Objects**
- An array can be viewed as a collection of indexed variables 
- An array can also be viewed as a single item whose value is a collection of values of a base type 

An array variable names the array as a single item 

e.g) `double[] a;`

A new expression creates an array object and stores the object in memory 

e.g) `new double[10]`

An assignment statement places a reference to the memory address of an array object in the array variable 

e.g) `a = new double[10];`	 


#### Pitfall: Arrays with a Class Base Type 
The base type of an array can be a class type 

e.g) `Date[] holidayList = new Date[20]; `

The above example creates 20 indexed variables of type Date 

But it does not create 20 objects of the class Date 

Than, each of these indexed variables are automatically initialized to null 
- Any attempt to reference any of them at this point would result in a "null pointer exception" error message 


#### Pitfall: Use of = and == with Arrays 
Because an array variable contains the memory address of the array it names, the assignment operator (=) only copies this memory address 
- It does not copy the values of each indexed variable 
- Using the assignment operator will make two array variables be different names for the same array 

e.g) `b = a; `

The memory address in a is now the same as the memory address in b.
They reference the same array 

For the same reason, the equality operator (==) only tests two arrays to see if they are stored in the same location in the computer's memory  (It does not test two arrays to see if they contain the same values)

e.g) `(a == b)` 

The result of the above boolean expression will be true if a and b share the same memory address (and, therefore, reference the same array), and false otherwise 


#### Arguments for the Method main 
The heading for the main method of a program has  a parameter for an array of String
- It is usually called args by convention  

e.g) `public static void main(String[] args) `

Note that since args is a parameter, it could be replaced  by any other non-keyword identifier  

If a Java program is run without giving an argument to main, then a default empty array of strings is automatically provided  

#### Privacy Leaks with Array Instance Variables 
If an accessor method does return the contents of an array, special care must be taken. (Just as when an accessor returns a reference to any private object)

The example above will result in a privacy leak 

![7.1](/assets/images/object_oriented_programming/6.4.png)

Instead, an accessor method should return a reference to a deep copy of the private array object

### Enumerated Types
Starting with version 5.0, Java permits enumerated types 

An enumerated type is a type in which all the values are given in a (typically) short list 

The definition of an enumerated type is normally placed outside of all methods in the same place that named constants are defined: 

e.g)

#### Some Methods Included with Every Enumerated Type

#### Multidimensional Arrays 
Multidimensional arrays are declared and created in basically the same way as one-dimensional arrays 

![7.1](/assets/images/object_oriented_programming/6.10.png)

In Java, a two-dimensional array, such as a, is actually an array of arrays 

The array a contains a reference to a one-dimensional array of size 5 with a base type of char[] 

Each indexed variable (a[0], a[1], etc.) contains a reference to a one-dimensional array of size 12, also with a base type of char 

A three-dimensional array is an array of arrays of arrays, and so forth for higher dimensions
