### Analog and digital signal
To be transmitted, data must be transformed to electromagnetic signals.

#### Analog signal
: Represent data with continuously varying electromagnetic wage

- Suffer more from attenuation which leads loss of information

#### Digital signal
: Represent data with sequence of voltage pulses

- Cheaper in price 
- Less susceptible to noise interference

### Performance 

**bandwidth in hertz**

: refers to the range of frequencies in a composite signal or the range of frequencies that a channel can pass. 

**bandwidth in bits per second**

: refers to the speed of bit transmission in a channel or link. 

**throughput**

: a measure of how fast we can actually send data through a network 

**latency**

: how long it takes for an entire message to completely arrive at the destination
